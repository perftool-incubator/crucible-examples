Status
PASS: { "arg": "test-file", "vals": ["/opt/flexran/bin/nr5g/gnb/testmac/custom/3-cells-test.cfg"], "role": "client" },
PASS: { "arg": "test-file", "vals": ["/opt/flexran/bin/nr5g/gnb/testmac/custom/4-cells-test.cfg"], "role": "client" },

Both are custom tests. They come from Intel fec-operator images.  On perf198, it will not pass with more than 4 cells.
This is for comparing with ACC100 (../TIMER-FEC) which can pass 12 cells.

v22.03 compiled with oneAPI
-------------------------
May fail both
cru*1.log has:
   Previous UL list is not completed CellId[0] Subframe[1321] PrevSubframe[1319] SfIdx[321] Ctx[1] gMySfn[1321]

This indicates FlexRAN was not been able to keep up.
